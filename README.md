# Workday Scheduler

This is a page designed for the user to create and make plans on an hour to hour basis for a particular workday.

## Features

Gives the current Time and Date
Notifies the user of current time with "Red" indicator bar
The gray indicator bars notify the user that the time has passed.
The green indicator bar notifies the user upcoming availability times.
The user is also able to input and save necessary reminders in each time slot to allow for organization even with the reloading of the page.

As a developer it is our job to make the user's experience as easy and rewarding as possible. This Workday Scheduler is the perfect example of this concept.
